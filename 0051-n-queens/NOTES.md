Observation
Only one queen can be placed in  a row or a col
we can use this and do a recorsive call for each col and placind in each row of that col
using for loop and then check all four diagonals and same row and col to check if we can place queen there if we can then place queen then do another call for next col and remove q from that pos so that next new board will have correct value
